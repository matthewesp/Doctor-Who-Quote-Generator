# Doctor-Who-XYZ

This is a project showcasing what can be done with React.

This project can be found on doctorwhoxyz.herokuapp.com or doctorwho.xyz

The project is really simple. So far this project utlizes react, however I will be implementing an express server that can have get and post request allowing us to access data via mongodb.

There will be a form allowing users to add their favorite videos, quotes, and other micellanous data needed, along with a user/login backend.
